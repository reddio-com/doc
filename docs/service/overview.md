# Overview

## Introduction

Reddio is a technology company that builds infrastructure for the blockchain, to help developers adopt blockchain technologies with the world's first easy-to-use layer 2 Agnostic APIs. 

By partnering with leading layer 2 providers like Starkware, zkSync, Scroll, Reddio builds the most stable and mature platform for any developers even without Web 3.0 experience to integrate so that they can have the instant transaction confirmation, massive scalability, and no gas fees for off-chain — without compromising user custody. 

## Why Reddio

### Time to market

With Reddio’s APIs, your integration to Web3.0 can be done in minutes.

### Highly scalable and reliable

On layer 2 transactions, 10k TPS are supported. 99.9% APIs availability is guaranteed.

### Secure and asset safety

Reddio leverage layer 2 to achieve scale while preserving the security of layer 1 Ethereum by producing STARK proofs off-chain and verifying those proofs on-chain. Meanwhile, all asset can be stored on layer 1, users can interact with their assets at anytime, and transfer your assets to layer 2 and layer 1 with few lines of code. 

### No smart contract experience needed

Reddio provides APIs for both layer 1 & layer 2 on all the functions, hence developers don’t need experience on smart contract, Reddio generates and operate the smart contract on your behalf with easy-to-understand APIs.

### Cross platform SDKs

We strive to make the integration easy for your applications, not only Javascript SDK is provided, Unity, iOS and Android SDKs are also provided too for future proof much better use experience.

### **No protocol lock in**

Reddio is partnering with all the major layer 2 providers, like Starkware, zkSync, Scroll, etc., to switch from one provider to another, is just a simple change of a parameter

### Zero gas fee(custom gas fee supported)

With the partnership like Starkware, we can offer zero gas fee on layer 2 for our StarkEx integration.

### Self service and instant support

Reddio is built by developers for developers, we know self-service is a must for developers hence we build toward this direction, all the APIs/SDKs are well documented with developer dashboard to facilitate all your needs. Meanwhile, support is provided with our ticketing system and Discord community. We listen to your need and convert them into products/APIs.

## How does it work

Layer 1 is the base blockchain. Ethereum and Bitcoin are both layer 1 blockchains. Layer 1 has been active in the past years, as we see more blockchains like BNB Smart Chain, Solana and Flow, etc., coming up.

Layer 2 is a collective term to describe a specific set of layer 1 scaling solutions. A layer 2 is a separate blockchain that extends layer 1 and inherits the security guarantees of layer 1. 

Layer 2 solutions are needed, both to immediately improve the congestion on the current layer 1 network, and to set the stage for mass adoption in the post-ETH 2.0 era for ETH and other layer 1 networks.

Reddio uses a zero-knowledge rollup on layer 2 to take thousands of off-chain transactions in a batch, generate a proof to make sure all the transactions are valid, then publish the proof on layer 1, then verify the proof by a smart contract.

The user’s assets are held on layer 1 in the smart contract during the process, and can only be released after a valid proof.
