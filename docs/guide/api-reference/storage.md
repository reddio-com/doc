# Storage

As reddio user you are able to upload metadata, files are under project's scope.

Note: This function is still in Alpha and we do not guarantee any SLA, upload file size limit is 100MiB.

## Upload file(s)

Uploading a single file is easy, just upload it!

If you'd like to upload a directory of files, you should convert them to [CAR](https://ipld.io/specs/transport/car/) format using `ipfs-car`, it's quite simple, just follow the following steps.

```
npm install -g ipfs-car
ipfs-car --pack /path/to/your/directory_name
```

Then a `directory_name.car` will be created, you can now just upload this file.
