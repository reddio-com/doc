## Checking contracts' detail

Currently, Reddio supports the import of standardized contracts such as [ERC721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) and [ERC20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) contracts. It is important to ensure that your contracts comply with these standards and have all the required functionalities before proceeding with the import process. Additionally, you will need to identify the correct contract address and network for successful importation.

## Importing contracts to Reddio

Importing an ERC20 or ERC721 smart contract on layer 1 is a straightforward process with the help of [Reddio's Dashboard](https://dashboard.reddio.com/). After registering on the dashboard, follow these steps to import your contract:

1. Visit the contracts page and locate the "Add Contracts" button.

By following these steps, you can easily import your contract and begin utilizing Reddio's features.

## Use Reddio’s functionalities to do more

While importing existing contracts enables you to trade your NFTs or tokens on layer 2 with zero gas fees, it's important to note that you won't be able to access Reddio's additional unique functionalities, such as free minting on layer 2. To leverage these features, you will need to utilize Reddio's dashboard to deploy an ERC721 contract with the mintable feature. For detailed guidance on this process, please refer to [this tutorial](https://docs.reddio.com/guide/getting-started/mint-nfts-on-layer-2.html).
