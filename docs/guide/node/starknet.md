# StarkNet Node

## Introduction

StarkNet is a decentralized Validity-Rollup, commonly referred to as a "ZK-Rollup". It functions as an L2 network on top of Ethereum, allowing any dApp to seamlessly scale its computations while retaining Ethereum's inherent composability and security.

For a limited time, Reddio offers a high-speed connection to the StarkNet Node free of charge with lowest delay. Discover why Reddio claims the fastest connection by [reading more here](https://blog.reddio.com/reddios-starknet-beta-node-launch-access-the-future-today/). 

## Grab your Reddio account

To gain entry to Reddio's Node, the first step is to create your very own Reddio account. It's a straightforward processâ€”just visit our [dashboard](https://dashboard.reddio.com/)  to sign up.

As an added bonus, for a limited time, you can enjoy unrestricted access to Reddio's Node entirely free of charge. And if you register your account before January 31, 2024, we have a special gift in store for you.

## Connecting to Reddio's Dedicated Starknet Node

Integrating with Reddio's Starknet node is simple. Go to [dashboard](https://dashboard.reddio.com/)'s Nodes page. You will see the endpoint with your api-key that you can access. 

Use the endpoint given on dashboard within your applications or during your development processes:

### Grab Starknet Mainnet Endpoint

The endpoint for Starknet mainnet looks like this:

```bash
https://starknet-mainnet.reddio.com/rk-85cfdc4d-683b-4bfa-a16e-xxxxxxxxxxxx
```

### Grab Starknet Sepolia Endpoint

The endpoint for Starknet mainnet looks like this:

```bash
https://starknet-sepolia.reddio.com/rk-85cfdc4d-683b-4bfa-a16e-xxxxxxxxxxxx
```

> Note that all above endpoint is for starknet version 0.6, if you want to use version 0.6 or 0.7, you can add `/rpc/v0_5` or `/rpc/v0_7` to the endpoint, for example:

* https://starknet-sepolia.reddio.com/rpc/v0_7/rk-85cfdc4d-683b-4bfa-a16e-xxxxxxxxxxxx


### Connect to the Node

Here's a Python example to guide you:

To begin, install `starknet_py` using pip:

```bash
pip install starknet_py
```

Once installed, retrieve the latest block with this code:

```python
from starknet_py.net.full_node_client import FullNodeClient

client = FullNodeClient(node_url="https://starknet-mainnet.reddio.com/rk-85cfdc4d-683b-4bfa-a16e-xxxxxxxxxxxx")
block = client.get_block_sync("latest")
print(block.block_number)
```
