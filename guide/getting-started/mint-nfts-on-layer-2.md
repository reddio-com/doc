# Mint NFTs On Layer 2

## Introduction

In this guide, let’s mint NFT on Layer 2.  This guide contains the following steps:

1. Install wallet 
2. Deploy an ERC721 mintable smart contract on Dashboard
3. Mint ERC721M tokens on layer 2

## Install wallet

1. Install [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) and create a [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) wallet.

2. Make sure you have enough ETH on the Sepolia Testnet because deploying an ERC721M smart contract needs some Sepolia ETH as the gas fee. If you don't have enough gas fee, you can [click here](https://discord.gg/wTv3h38pZ3) for help.

## Deploy an ERC721 mintable smart contract on Dashboard

You can easily deploy an ERC721M smart contract on layer 1 by utilizing [RedSonic's Dashboard](https://dashboard.reddio.com/). Once you have registered on the dashboard, navigate to the contracts page and click on the "Add Contracts" button. Select ERC721 (Mintable and Recommended). And then, you need to type in all the information about this contract then click "OK":

Then, your wallet will pop up to prompt you to sign the transaction. Once you have successfully signed all the transactions, your deployment will be processed.

After your deployment process is finished, you will see your new contract name under "Contracts" page:
