# Overview

The [Reddio Points System](https://points.reddio.com/) is designed to reward users for their engagement within the ecosystem. There are two types of points you can earn: **Staking Points** and **Task Points**. Both contribute to unlocking exciting rewards, moving up tiers, and enhancing your overall experience on Reddio.
## Staking Points

**Staking Points** are the primary way to earn rewards on Reddio. These points can only be earned by staking tokens or inviting friends to stake. Here’s how you can earn Staking Points:

- **Earn by Staking**

    You accumulate Staking Points by locking your tokens in Reddio’s staking pool. The amount of points you earn depends on the value and duration of the stake.
	- **For every 0.01 ETH staked** = 1 Staking Point per day
	- **For every 50 USDT staked** = 1 Staking Point per day

    In addition to earning points daily, staking larger amounts can give you lottery chances to win extra rewards. For example:

	- **Stake 0.1 ETH or 500 USDT** and get one lottery entry daily to win bonus points.

- **Earn by Referring Friends**: 

    You can also earn Staking Points by inviting friends to join Reddio and stake their tokens. When your referred friends stake, you’ll earn 10% of the points they generate.

    For example:

	- If your friend stakes 10 ETH and earns 1000 points, you receive **100 points** as a bonus.

- **Staking Leaderboard**

   The [Staking Leaderboard](https://points.reddio.com/leaderboard) offers additional rewards for those who reach the top ranking positions. Special rewards are available for the top 100,000 stakers, with exclusive bonuses for top positions. 
## Task Points

**Task Points** are earned by completing specific tasks and participating in the platform’s daily or special activities. These points encourage continuous engagement and interaction within the Reddio ecosystem.

- **Daily and Special Tasks**

    You can earn Task Points by completing various daily tasks, such as:

	- **Authenticating on social platforms** (e.g., linking your Twitter or Discord)
	- **Interacting with Reddio’s social media** (e.g., following, retweeting, or posting about Reddio)
	- **Joining the Reddio Discord server** and obtaining certain roles (e.g., VERIFIED or ACTIVE status)

    Each task comes with a specified number of points. For example:

	•	**Follow @reddio_com on Twitter** = 10 points
	•	**Join Reddio’s Discord server** = 10 points
	•	**Post about Reddio on Twitter** = 10 points

    Daily check-ins and ongoing participation in the community can also earn additional points.

- **Staking Lottery**

    After staking tokens, you can participate in a daily lottery to earn more Task Points. The lottery gives you a chance to win up to 300 Task Points based on your stake size.

    For example:

	- **Stake 0.1 ETH** and enter a daily lottery with chances to win up to **50 Task Points**.

## Card Collection Gamification

As part of the staking process, users can earn special cards through the daily lottery. These cards come in different rarities (e.g., Common, Rare, Super Rare, Ultra Rare), and collecting them can unlock unique, non-transferable SBTs (Soulbound Tokens).

- **Collect 5 cards of the same rarity** to combine them into a Soulbound Token, which offers special benefits.
- **Lottery Chances**: Each lottery entry gives you a chance to win cards or points. The rarer the card, the more valuable the reward.

For example:

- Collect 5 **N Cards** to earn a Tier 1 SBT.
- Collect 5 **SSR Cards** to earn a higher-level SBT, which grants exclusive perks in the Reddio ecosystem.
