# Overview

Reddio is a high performance parallel Ethereum-compatible Layer 2, leveraging zero-knowledge technology to achieve unrivaled computation scale with Ethereum-level security.

Reddio is compatible with Ethereum's APIs. All smart contracts deployed on Ethereum can be seamlessly implemented on Reddio. The blockchain is currently in its testing phase, and can be utilized for trial purposes.

Reddio presents a collection of pivotal enhancements, to achieve high performance compared to current EVM L2s or zkEVM L2s:

- [Parallel Execution](/zkevm/parallel)
- [GPU Acceleration](/zkevm/gpuacceleration)
- [Modular Sequencer](/zkevm/sequencer)

Reddio is designed to enhance current blockchain capabilities while maintaining full compatibility for both developers and end-users. Our solution supports complete EVM bytecode compatibility and the Ethereum RPC API, enabling effortless integration with a wide range of Ethereum tools and research innovations. This ensures that:

- Applications: Any dApp built for Ethereum
- Developer tools: Hardhat, Apeworx, Foundry, etc.
- Wallets: MetaMask, etc.
- Analytics and indexing services: Etherscan, Dune, etc.
